1- Node cannot be burned or paused once created, but minting new Nodes can be paued...

2- Node Reward has specific interval

3- Calculate Reward will return Reward from last interaction no matter if claim time is completed...

4- Node reward can be compounded.

5- Once node is Compunded into Vault, its Current Reward will be staked in vault.

6- Vault allows stake in 3 methods   Direct ETHs/ Compound Node Reward/ Compound Vault Rewards...

7- Can we return from Compound back in Node ???

8- After compound where the next reward goes ???

9- We cannot deposit Reward into distributor contract until we have atleast one staker, else DividendPerShare = 0

10- After deployment, owner needs to Addliquidity to DEX, and call function "settransferenabled()".

11- During Lauch tax period all the tAX in ETHS goes to ETHS contract.
